<h3 style="color:#eebbcb;">What is Loltochess(TFT)?</h3>
<p> 
	ãƒ»Teamfight Tactics(TFT) is Riot Games' answer to the newly popular auto Chess or Autobattler genre. <br>
	An alternative game mode for League of Legends, TFT is based on the orginal Dota Auto Chess custom game for Dota2.<br> 
</p>
	<h3 style="color:#eebbcb;">GameplayðŸŽ®<br></h3>
<p>
		<p style="color: #eebbcb; text-align; left;">Teamfight Tactics is an autobattler: </p>
		<p style="text-align; left;">a round-based PvP game where youâ€™ll draft a team that battles automatically on your behalf.<br>
		If you've never played an autobattler before, don't worry! TFT borrows from many of the concepts you know and love about other strategy games, <br>
		like drafting from a shared pool of resources, team building, economy management, and positioning.<br><br></p>

		<p style="color: #eebbcb;">Here's how it works: </p>
		Individuals face off in 1-on-1 matches until only one player remains. <br>
		You win by drafting the best team of champions from a shared pool, equipping them with powerful items,<br>
		managing your gold income to buy out the competition, and positioning your team in winning battle formations. There are unlimited winning strategies, <br>
		so youâ€™ll have to adapt to different situations in every game to come out on top.
